# Pressure-distribution-calculations
There is a hydrocarbon reservoir, represented by four-block grid. Implement function that calculates the pressure distribution over time for all cells  using explicit and implicit schemes. Perform Material Balance check in each of the above cases and comment on stability of the solution when comparing the explicit versus implicit scheme.
